# Maze Pathfinding Algorithms for Robotics Project

This project is developed as part of the Robotics Techniques course, focusing on solving mazes using three powerful optimization algorithms:

1. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
2. **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**
3. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**

These algorithms are implemented to find the shortest and most efficient paths in a maze environment, a common challenge in autonomous robotics and AI.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

* Develop efficient pathfinding algorithms inspired by natural phenomena.
* Compare the performance of ACO, ABC, and PSO for maze navigation.
* Implement visualization for better understanding of algorithm behaviors.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.9+
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy


You can customize the maze size, algorithm parameters, and visualization settings within the code.

## 📊 Results and Analysis

The project outputs include:

* Path visualizations for each algorithm.
* Comparative analysis of performance metrics like path length and computation time.

## 📝 Future Work

* Implement more optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
* Add real-time visualization.
* Test with different maze complexities.
